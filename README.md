# Airbnb Dashboard Project  
**Project Title:** Interactive Airbnb Dashboard Analytics  

## 🧮 Project Overview  
This project presents an interactive dashboard built in Tableau using Airbnb listing and review data. The aim is to explore patterns, trends and insights such as pricing dynamics, geographic distribution, host behaviour and review-sentiment (or whichever you focused on) across diverse listings.

## 🎯 Objective  
- To visualise key metrics: average price, number of reviews, occupancy trends, room types, neighbourhood segmentation, etc.  
- To identify hotspots for listing activity and pricing variance.  
- To provide actionable insights for hosts, property managers or analysts (e.g., recommendations to optimise pricing or targeting).  
- To demonstrate competency in data preparation, dashboard design & storytelling with Tableau.  

## 🗂️ Data Source  
The dataset used is from Kaggle:  
[Airbnb Listing Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dgomonov/new-york-city-airbnb-open-data) — This particular version covers New York City listings and includes listing details, host information, geographic coordinates, pricing, reviews, availability, etc. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}

Feel free to replace the link above if you used a different dataset from Kaggle — e.g., global listings, U.S. dataset or another city.  
- Dataset description: “This data file includes all needed information to find out more about hosts, geographical availability, necessary metrics to make predictions and draw analyses.” :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}  
- Example other dataset: U.S. Airbnb Open Data (AB_US_2023.csv) with features such as host id, listing id, latitude/longitude, etc. :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}  

## 📊 Dashboard Features  
- Interactive filters: e.g., room type, neighbourhood, price range.  
- Map visualisation showing listing density by geography.  
- Trend lines for number of reviews over time or availability.  
- Pricing distribution and outlier detection.  
- Host-level summary (e.g., super-hosts vs regular hosts).  
- Key takeaways and recommendations section.

## 💡 Key Insights  
(List the major findings you uncovered. For example:)  
- Listings in neighbourhood X have the highest average price but lowest review count.  
- Entire home/apartment room type shows 30 % higher average price than private rooms.  
- Host response rate correlates positively with review count and rating.  
- Off-peak months (Nov-Feb) show 20 % lower occupancy though price remains flat.

## 🎛️ Tools & Technologies  
- Tableau Desktop / Tableau Public  
- CSV / Excel for data cleaning  
- (Optional) Python / R for preprocessing (if you used them)  
- Git & GitHub for version control & publication  

## 🚀 How to View  
1. Download the `dashboard.twbx` file from this repository.  
2. Open it in Tableau Desktop (version 2024 or later recommended).  
3. If using Tableau Public, click the share link (if published) to view interactively online.  
4. Use the filters / controls to interact with the data and explore insights.

## ✅ Future Work  
- Incorporate additional cities/datasets for comparative study.  
- Use sentiment-analysis on review texts for deeper insight.  
- Develop predictive modelling (e.g., price prediction) using derived features.  
- Embed the dashboard into a web application / interactive site.
